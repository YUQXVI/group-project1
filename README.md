# group-project1
The first group project (started during week 6)

David Reidenbaugh, Kyle Lehman, Yuanheng Qu


So far the python program asks the user for their name, number in PITT ID, and the year they were born.
It uses these inputs to print out a customized greeting that welcomes the reader by their PITT ID and determines how many years ago they were born.
